			  The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing was designed mainly for ebooks like the <a href="https://railstutorial.org/"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>book</a>
			  and <a href="https://learnenough.com/html/"><em>Learn Enough HTML to be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em> Moby-Dick</em>
			  by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em> Moby Dik</em>). We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.

			<h3>Moby-Dick: A classic tale of the sea</h3>

			  <a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="blank" rel="noopener"><em>Moby-Dick</em></a> by Herman Melville begins with this immortal words:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
				  <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought
				  I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is the way I have of driving of the spleen and regulating the circulation.
				</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
				  After driving of his spleen (which, <em>can't</em> be good for you), Ishamel then goes on in much the same vein for approximately a jillion pages. The only thing bigger than
				  Moby Dick (who <em>spoiler alert!</em>&ndash;is a giant whale) is the book itself.
